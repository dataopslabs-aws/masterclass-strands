      "\n",
      "2. **Highest Growth Premium**: NVIDIA (NVDA) has the highest PE ratio (45.95), reflecting investors' expectations for continued exceptional growth in AI chip demand, though its PEG ratio of 1.76 is more reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Profit Margin Leader**: NVIDIA stands out with an impressive 51.7% profit margin, significantly higher than peers, demonstrating exceptional operational efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Dividend Income**: Microsoft offers the highest dividend yield at 0.70%, making it more attractive for income-oriented investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Risk Assessment**: NVIDIA has the highest beta (2.12), indicating greater price volatility compared to the market, while Microsoft (1.026) and Alphabet (1.014) have betas closest to the market average.\n",
